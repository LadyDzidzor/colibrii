                        <p>Hiring a virtual assistant the right way is critical to ensuring that you reap all the benefits that come with them.
                        Otherwise, they might become another problem you may have to solve. These are some general tips to help you avoid
                        mistakes when hiring a virtual assistant. Here are a few of them.</p><br>
                        <h4>1. Failing to understand the usefulness of a virtual assistant</h4><br>
                        <p>Virtual assistants are useful for a purpose but if you don’t know their purpose, it will be difficult to hire the right
                        one to start with. A bad way to go about hiring a virtual assistant is anticipating business growth without having any
                        clear task for them to do. A bad move would be to hire virtual assistants because other businesses are doing so. In both
                        instances, you would not know which specific personality or skill sets to look out for when hiring.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>2. Failing to provide the proper training</h4><br>
                        <p>When hiring a virtual assistant, you must take into consideration the need to train them. Virtual assistants do not know
                        your business as you do. It is your duty to bring them up to speed. It is also your responsibility to give them clear
                        instructions on the kinds of tasks you want them to undertake. This would help you glean the best from them, saving you
                        time and money. This means you must be patient, provide constant feedback, avoid vagueness and communicate constantly
                        with your assistant.</p><br>
                        <h4>3. Not providing a qualifying framework</h4><br>
                        <p>You should never hire a virtual assistant simply because they have an impressive resume. Just as it is with hiring any
                        employee, a workable system must govern the screening of virtual assistants. Consider an interview, an evaluation of
                        personal qualities and skill sets and a behavioural test to assess them holistically. This would give you a better
                        picture of the candidate you seek to hire. Do your due diligence at this stage to prevent having to do the job all over
                        again. You would have to do all of these if you are hiring a virtual assistant yourself but if you request the services
                        of a virtual assistant from a virtual assistant company, you would not have to go through any of this process. They
                        would take care of it for you.</p><br>
                        <h4>4. Not considering enough candidates</h4><br>
                        <p>Don’t hire the very first candidate you interview just because they impressed you. Trust me, several others will amaze
                        you. Wait until you have a pool of candidates and carefully compare all their personal qualities, skill sets and
                        experience to get yourself the ideal fit for your business. A virtual assistant company like Colibri also allows you to
                        change a virtual assistant if you are not satisfied with your first choice.</p><br>
                            <h4>5. Lack of a clear communication</h4><br>
                            <p>A virtual assistant would not be with you all the time. This does not mean that you should not set up some good quality
                            control measures and constantly take progress reports. There are communication channels you can use for voice calls,
                            video calls and emails; you can establish constant communication with the virtual assistant. This is critical for a good
                            working relationship and an appreciation of your business needs.</p><br>



                        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
                        <p>If you must free up your time and improve productivity with virtual assistants, avoiding common mistakes that most
                        people make would save you heartaches. It is possible to have a great working relationship with virtual assistants who
                        will in turn work with you for your personal and business success when you hire correctly.</p>
